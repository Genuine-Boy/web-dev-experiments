Javascript, HTML, CCS, and Bootstrap shenanigans. Very Memeish

This is just for fun and for the process of learning some web stuff. Most of this is based on templates from W3 Schools, if you are interested.

Don't expect anything here to be for profit or for use in just about any fashion beyond just for goofing around. Oh, and I am sorry in advance.
